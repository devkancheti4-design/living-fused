"""Life — exact, permanent, honest memory for any LLM.

One file. Python 3.8+. Zero dependencies. The memory is a local JSON file.

Why this exists: a gradient-trained LLM cannot give you exact, permanent,
honest recall — not as a missing feature, but as a measured consequence of
how it is trained (see proof/PROOF.md, reproducible in ~2 minutes).
The Life is the complementary organ: exact where the model is fuzzy,
permanent where the model forgets, and it says ABSTAIN where the model
would confidently guess.

What it is NOT (read HONEST LIMITS in README.md): it is exact-key only.
It cannot answer a paraphrase, it does not generalize, it does not reason.
Pair it with your model (reasoning) and, if you need fuzzy search, RAG.

CLI:
  python3 life.py put  KEY VALUE     store / revise a fact (newest wins)
  python3 life.py get  KEY           exact recall — value (exit 0) or ABSTAIN (exit 3)
  python3 life.py history KEY        full revision history with counts
  python3 life.py link A B           relate two keys (A -> B)
  python3 life.py chain KEY          follow relations multi-hop
  python3 life.py forget KEY         delete a key (exit 3 if it was absent)
  python3 life.py stats              keys, disk bytes, identity sha
  python3 life.py sha                identity hash (byte-exact twins match)
  python3 life.py doctor             is the Life fused & working HERE? (checklist)

The database file is ./life.json (override: --db PATH or env LIFE_DB).

Performance honesty: recall() in-process is ~1 microsecond [HW]. The CLI
round-trip is ~30-100 ms — interpreter start + whole-file load — and every
CLI write rewrites the whole file (O(N)). At large stores, use the Life
class in-process; the CLI is the zero-integration path, not the fast path.

      the full history stays inspectable. A plain dict destroys history.
    - recall() on an absent key returns None — structural abstention.

    - blend() folds the table into a model's output distribution with a
      confidence gate w = t/(t+C): unseen keys leave the model untouched,
      well-attested keys override it. This is the fusion organ — the one
      thing here a dict fundamentally does not have.
